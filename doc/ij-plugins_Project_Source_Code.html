<h2>ij-plugins CVS Repository</h2>

<p>Currently there are 4 projects within ij-plugins CVS
    repository:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><b>ij-plugins:</b></dt>

    <dd>Contains majority of the code for plugins. Currently all of
        the plugins there are contained in the 3D Toolkit plugin
        bundle.</dd>

    <dt><b>imageio:</b></dt>

    <dd>Code related to JAI-image I/O plugin bundle. Uses the JAI
        Sample IO code released by SUN (see the next project).</dd>

    <dt><b>itk4j:</b></dt>

    <dd>ITK Image/J plugins and general utility classes to simplify
        use of ITK from Java.</dd>

    <dt><b>Sun_JAI_Sample_IO_Source_Code_v_1.1.1:</b></dt>

    <dd>JAI I/O source code released bu SUN. Probably the only thing
        added is an Ant build file to compile the code and create a JAR.
        Note that original source code had no package structure.</dd>

    <dt><b>VTK-Examples:</b></dt>

    <dd>Source code for VTK-Examples. This really has no dependencies
        on Image/J. It is hosted within ij-plugins project
        "temporarily".</dd>
</dl>

<p>Please see ij-plugins website for more general information
    about the projects.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>Generally source code for each project is organized into a
    similar directory structure (at least this the goal :)</p>

<pre>
    project_root
    |
    |----- build.xml
    |
    |----- lib
    |
    |----- src
    |
    |----- doc
    |
    |----- example
</pre>

<dl>
    <dt><tt>build.xml:</tt></dt>

    <dd>Apache Ant build file for building, testing, and creation of
        distribution files. The intent is to have an IDE independent
        means of rebuilding a project.</dd>

    <dt><tt>lib:</tt></dt>

    <dd>Possible libraries (JARs) needed to build project.</dd>

    <dt><tt>src:</tt></dt>

    <dd>Project source code.</dd>

    <dt><tt>doc:</tt></dt>

    <dd>Documentation, except generated documentation like javadocs.
        Generated documentation will be created from Ant. Depending on
        executed target, Ant will create new directories<tt>output</tt>
        and<tt>dist</tt>. The generated documentation may be created in
        <tt>output/doc</tt>or<tt>dist/doc</tt>.</dd>

    <dt><tt>example:</tt></dt>
    <dd>Programming examples.</dd>
</dl>

Currently some of the projects deviate somewhat from this
structure.

<h3>ij-plugins</h3>

<p>ij-plugins CVS project has main build.xml file, a 'lib'
    directory, and two parallel directory trees: Toolkit and Plugins.
    Each has its own Ant build file. The Toolkit directory contains
    library code organized into typical Java packages. The Plugins
    directory contains plugin 'drivers' that follow Image/J plugin
    naming convention, subdirectories group related plugins (3D IO,
    3D Toolkit, VTK Filters).</p>

<p>A recent feature of Image/J enables installing plugins
    packaged into JAR files through a declaration file included in
    the JAR. This new feature makes directory structure of ij-plugins
    obsolete. In particular there is no longer need for the Plugins
    source directory since it role can be taken by the declaration
    file included in the JAR.</p>

<p>There are some JUnit test cases. More will be include with new
    source. Test cases for older code will be added.</p>

<h3>imageio</h3>

<p>imageio CVS project contains simple the source code, directly
    in its root directory. Structure of this project will soon change
    and it is updated to make use of the new Image/J JAR plugin
    installation facility. For instance PNG writer will be added to
    File/Save As menu, JAI reader will be added to File/Import
    menu</p>

<h3>VTK-Examples</h3>

<p>Directory structure of the VTK-Examples is set to match
    directory structure of the VTK source code, rather than a typical
    Java application.</p>

<h2>Coding Standards</h2>

<ul>
    <li>There are no formalized coding standards, though, a typical
        Java convention described at http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/
        is generally followed.</li>

    <li>Please put javadoc comments to describe API. UML
        documentation encouraged :)</li>

    <li>Please add comments when checking in code into CVS. The
        comment should describe intention of the commit rather than
        content.</li>

    <li>Please use JUnit test cases when possible. Test cases are put
        together with the source they test. JUnit test classes have
        suffix Test, for instance, VtkDecoder class may have a
        corresponding VtkDecoderTest unit test. Test code can be easily
        filtered out from the distribution using Ant.</li>
</ul>
