`ijp-toolkit2` is the next generation of the [[http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/plugins/toolkit.html IJ-Plugins Toolkit]].
Initial focus is on improved speed using parallel algorithms.
The other original `IJ-Plugins Toolkit` (v.1.*) and `ijp-toolkit2` (v.2.*) can be used together.
Only upgraded algorithms are moved from v.1 to v.2, so there should be no conflicts.

The source code for `ijp-toolkit2` is hosted at [[http://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-toolkit2 GitHub ij-plugins/ijp-toolkit2]].
